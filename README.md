This code takes in two user inputs which are numbers and compares them. It prints out whether the first value is less than, greater than, or equal to the second value
My name is Jacob and I peer reviewd Carlos's Greater than or less than
I like how organized the code was. It made it easy to navigate through it
He used .ToUpper() and TryParse to make sure all of the inputs were valid
